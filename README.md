# MiniPiano

Creating a real-looking piano using Python involves building a GUI that visually resembles a piano with clickable keys that play real piano sounds.

We'll use:

tkinter: For the graphical interface

pygame: For playing sound files

Realistic layout: White and black keys arranged like an actual piano
